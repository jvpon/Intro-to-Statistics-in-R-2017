MODULE II. Statistical Inference. Parametric tests.
- Parametric tests
  - One-sample test on the sample mean for the random sample drawn from the normally distributed population with known variance: z-test
  - One-sample test on the sample mean for the sample with unknown variance: t-test
  - Two-sample paired and unpaired tests with unknown variance: t-test
  - Test for proportions: prop.test()
  - Fisher's exact test on proportions
- Confidence intervals and t-distribution
